# Animal Sanctuary Array Methods Project

This project presents a series of challenges to help the user practice and master some of the most important and useful Javascript Array Methods. Each challenge consists of a new problem and a way for the user to utilize an array method to solve it. This project uses Javascript HTML, CSS, React and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
